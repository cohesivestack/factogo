Persist registers the function, over a designed Factory, used to persist a
product Struct.

Note that Persist won't call the function to persist, it only registers
the function. The function is called when the Produce() method is called over
a designed Factory.

In case Factogo has registered a default Persist function, registering a Persist
function, over the Factory instance, overrides the default Persist function.
